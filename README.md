👋 Hi, I’m Dires — an aspiring Software Engineer who loves building scalable software, elegant algorithms, and impactful products worldwide.  

🎓 I’m a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Williams College, Class of 2028, passionate about problem-solving and innovation.  

⚡ My interests include coding, problem-solving, soccer, biking, workouts, entrepreneurship, technology, finance, and applying algorithms to practical challenges.  

🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on innovative projects with a focus on accessibility, education, entrepreneurship, and transformative technologies.  

😅 Fun fact: My code runs on coffee, occasional late-night brainstorming, and the occasional miracle — sometimes it works!
